## Problem Statement:

- People of San Jose are demanding a new parking garage to be built.

- The new garage should be similar to San Jose State University's garage with some cool new features. 

## Description:

We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing the parking garage:

- The parking garage would consist of multiple floors for customers to park their vehicles.

- The parking garage would have several entry and exit points.

- People can get a parking ticket from the entry points and can pay the fee at the exit points while leaving.

- People can pay for the tickets at the automated exit panel or to the parking attendant.

- People can choose to pay via either cash or credit cards or debit cards.

- Each floor would consist of customer's info portal where the customers can pay for the ticket and in this case, those customers would not have to pay at the exit points.

- The system should not allow more vehicles than the maximum capacity of the parking lot. If the parking is full, the system should be able to show a message at the entrance panel and on the parking display board on the ground floor.

- Each parking floor will have many parking spots. The system should support multiple types of parking spots such as Compact, Large, Handicapped, Motorcycle, etc.

- The Parking lot should have some parking spots specified for electric cars. These spots should have an electric panel through which customers can pay and charge their vehicles.

- The system should support parking for different types of vehicles like car, truck, van, motorcycle, etc.

- Each parking floor should have a display board showing any free parking spot for each spot type.

- The system should support a per-hour parking fee model. For example, customers have to pay $4 for the first hour, $3.50 for the second and third hours, and $2.50 for all the remaining hours.

## Operations:

- Admin: 
       Mainly responsible for adding and modifying parking floors, parking spots, entrance, and exit panels, adding/removing parking attendants, etc.

- Customer: 
       All customers can get a parking ticket and pay for it.

- Parking attendant: 
       Parking attendants can do all the activities on the customerâ€™s behalf, and can take cash for ticket payment.

- System: 
       To display messages on different info panels, as well as assigning and removing a vehicle from a parking spot in a particular floor.

## Functionalities:
