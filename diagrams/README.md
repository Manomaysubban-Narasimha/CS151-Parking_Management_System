| [`Class Diagram`](https://github.com/Manomaysubban-Narasimha/CS151-Parking_Management_System/blob/main/diagrams/Parking%20System%20Class%20Diagram.drawio.png) | Showcases overall design of classes and relationships among them for the parking system. Showcases various vehicle types and appropriate parkings, as well as how the various components tie into parking tickets and the payment system. Also shows the various panels at the entrance, exit, and each floor. |
| [`State Diagram`](https://github.com/Manomaysubban-Narasimha/CS151-Parking_Management_System/blob/main/diagrams/Project%20UML%20State%20Diagram.pdf) | Provides overview of the payment system process. The customer's ticket is processed at the exit panel and, if the payment is yet to be made, the payment is requested, and processed. If successful, the option of printing the reciept is given, and the gate is opened. If unsuccessful, an error is displayed. Pre-paid tickets are also processed and the gate opens. |
| [`Use Case Diagram`](https://github.com/Manomaysubban-Narasimha/CS151-Parking_Management_System/blob/main/diagrams/Project%20UML%20Use%20Case%20Diagram%202.pdf) | Showcases role of different actors for the parking system. Customers can pay for and scan their tickets, while parking attendants can also do so on behalf of the customer, as well as edit and update their account info. The parking system manages adding and removing vehicles from parking spots, and displaying parking spots that are available. Finally, the admin manages core features, like the number of parking floors and the parking rate. |
| [`Timing Diagram`](https://github.com/Manomaysubban-Narasimha/CS151-Parking_Management_System/blob/main/diagrams/UML%20Timing%20Diagram.png) | Shows how states change from time to time. |
